This project created for improving the results of a paper from the [journal of applied physics](https://aip.scitation.org/journal/jap).

"[Optical modeling and electrical properties of cadmium oxide nanofilms: Developing a meta–heuristic calculation process model](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4916720)" is the title of this paper. 

**Abstract**

Cadmium oxide thin films were deposited onto glass substrates by sol–gel dip-coating method and annealed in air. The normal incidence transmittance of the films was measured by a spectrophotometer. D.C electrical parameters such as carrier concentration and mobility were analyzed by Hall Effect measurements. A combination of Forouhi–Bloomer & standard Drude model was used to simulate the optical constants and thicknesses of the films from transmittance data. The transmittance spectra of the films in the visible domain of wavelengths were successfully fitted by using the result of a hybrid particle swarm optimization method and genetic algorithm. The simulated transmittance is in good accordance with the measured spectrum in the whole measurement wavelength range. The electrical parameters obtained from the optical simulation are well consistent with those measured electrically by Hall Effect measurements.
